# What is MIOU?

Take a look at this article for more details: https://pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/07/intersection-over-union-iou-for-object-detection/

At its core, intersection over union is the overlapping area divided by the total area for two regions. This is to determine as to how accurate the segmentation or bounding algorithm might be. Mean Intersection over Union is the average IOU for all the different prediction classes in an image. It's much more complicated, but know that it's based on the same principle.
