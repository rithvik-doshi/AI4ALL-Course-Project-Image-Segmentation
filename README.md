# AI4ALL-Course-Project-Image-Segmentation

This repository contains a light version of sacmehta's EdgeNets and a few exercises for students in the AI4ALL program to navigate. Please check out https://github.com/sacmehta/EdgeNets for the full model

## Goals:

- Understand how to navigate a research project
- Understand how to use the shell for basic commands
- Understand how image segmentation works on a high level
- Understand how to test a machine learning model
- Understand how to evaluate a machine learning model

## Steps:

### Starting off

1. To start with, go through this project and look at a couple of files. Try to see how they are related to each other. We will go over this together just to make sure everyone understands.
~~2. Make a copy of the template Google Colab project, and clone this repostiory into the project using: `git clone https://github.com/rithvik-doshi/AI4ALL-Course-Project-Image-Segmentation` in the terminal (you will have to use the following code in your Jupyter Notebook:)

```python
import os
os.system("git clone https://github.com/rithvik-doshi/AI4ALL-Course-Project-Image-Segmentation.git")
```
~~

3. Take a look at and read the intro to shell file, so that you can learn how to use the command line
4. Look around in some of the other project files and folders.

### Investigating the project files

1. Take a look at the main.py file. This is the python file that is intended to be run to make the whole project work.
2. Trace the imports of the file and see if you can find any related .py files. What do they do on a large scale?
3. Which file is the machine learning model found in?
4. Which file does the data collection occur in?
5. Which file does the data visualization occur in?

### Filling in the blanks

1. In test_segmentation.py, data.py and main.py in that order, fill in the code blanks with the requisite code.
2. Make sure to test each part out to make sure it is working before moving on to the next file.
3. Take notes about the key concepts that you learn

### Final Presentation

1. Create a presentation with your group covering the following topics:

- What did you learn about?
- Describe the machine learning model at work
- What is the ML model doing?
- How does the project test the model?
- How do we know whether the project works?
